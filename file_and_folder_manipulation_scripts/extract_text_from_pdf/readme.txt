The pdf you are extracting text from must be in the same folder as the main.py script. Modify the code to point to the file you want to extract text from.

You also need to install the following library by running the command:
pip3 install PyMuPDF 

If you are on Linux just run the example command to put it in a text file to grep for later:
```
main.py > text.txt
```
